# Heading 1: The Project Style Guide

## Heading 2: Typography and Text Elements

### Heading 3: Standard Text

**Bold text** is used for strong emphasis. _Italic text_ is used for mild emphasis. You can also combine **_bold and italic_**. Strikethrough is used for deleted content: ~~This is old information.~~

This is a regular paragraph of text. It should wrap nicely and show how line-height and alignment are handled. We can also include an inline link to [an external resource](https://example.com) for testing link styles, and some `inline code` for technical terms.

### Heading 4: Block Quotes

> This is a blockquote. It's often used to cite external sources or highlight important information. It can span multiple lines to test indentation and padding.
>
> > You can also nest blockquotes for deeper context.
>
> The quote is now finished.

interface Config {
  theme: string;
  version: number;
}
