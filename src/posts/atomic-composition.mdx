- Fernando's Talk
- components/ui makes no sense
- atomic design, but adjusted for React
- atoms, molecules, and pages
- actually integrate shadcn components into the project
- makes breadth first search more difficult as atoms and molecules folders grow,
  but depth first search makes more sense in a codebase built around top down
  design. you should start from the top, not the bottom.
